# Wallpapers

This is a collection of images I use as wallpapers. None of them were created by 
me, and if you're the original creator and would like me to remove them then just 
let me know and I'll remove them.

If you want to see a preview of the images, check out the 
[Preview.md](Preview.md) 
file.


## Sources

Most wallpapers come from [mut-ex/wallpapers](https://github.com/mut-ex/wallpapers)
and I try to always keep this repo up to date with this other one. Besides those, I
also added a couple of images myself.
